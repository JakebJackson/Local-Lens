# Local Lens - News Data Tracker 

## Project Information 

Local Lens is a collaborative project designed to help users search, track, and save local news articles in any global search destination. The initial inspiration behind the construction of this project was to combine both the use of a "News Data" API and the "Google Maps" API, granting all users the ability to readily access current news events in a given area, whether it be for research use, event planning, or general interest.

The construction of this project utilizes two main coding languages: HTML and JavaScript functionality, in combination with the SEMANTIC UI plugin. Using these languages creates a smooth user experience while also providing a comprehensive understanding for other developers seeking a deeper insight into the ins and outs of the method process.

The use of the "News Data" API allows users to search for any current news events within the last seven days of a given destination. Using this in combination with the "Google Maps" API gives an exact pinpoint location of any searched news events with the added ability of radius parameters depending on how refined the user wishes to have their data retrieved.

The undertaking of this project had its challenging aspects of API implementtation and functionality but in doing so has given each collaborator an improved knowledge base aswell as a point of reference for future use. 

## Usage

Using the "Local Lens" site is very user-friendly for first-time users. Simply enter a desired country, city, and radius parameter, and 'click' "search". The "Google Maps" API will generate your desired destination, and the "News Data" API will fetch current news articles for your targeted location. Should you wish to save a particular article, simply click the "Save" button below and navigate to your "Saved Headlines" tab located at the top of your page. All "Saved Headlines" will be saved to your local storage for future use. By using the "inspect" element in your Google Chrome tools, users and developers can see the functionality of the code's process if they seek insight into the workings of the project.
