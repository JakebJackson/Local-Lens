# Local Lens - News Data Tracker 

## Project Information 

Local Lens is a collaborative project designed to help users search, track, and save local job listings in global search destinations. This project combines both the use of a "Adzuna" API and the "Google Maps" API, granting all users the ability to readily access 10 job listings per search in a given area, given a given job title whether it be for research use, career planning, or general interest.

The construction of this project utilizes two main coding languages: HTML and JavaScript functionality, in combination with the SEMANTIC UI responsive CSS framework. Using these languages creates a smooth user experience while also providing a comprehensive understanding for other developers seeking a deeper insight into the ins and outs of the method process.

The use of the "Adzuna" API allows users to search a list for up to 10, title specific, jobs within a given destination. Using this in combination with the "Google Maps" API gives an exact pinpoint location of any searched news events with the added ability of radius parameters depending on how refined the user wishes to have their data retrieved.

## Usage

Using the "Local Lens" site is very user-friendly for first-time users.  
* Simply enter a desired job title, city, country and radius, and click "search".   
* Alternatively you can click on a map area to retrieve up to 10 random job listings within a 20km radius.  
* User is also able to enter a job title, click on a map area, and reveal 10 jobs within that area, under that job title, thus using both methods (text input to retrieve data and map click).  
* Should you wish to save a particular article, simply click the "Save" button in the listing and navigate to the "Saved Headlines" tab located at the top of your page.   
* All "Saved Jobs" will be saved to your local storage for future use.   
* By using the "inspect" element in your Google Chrome tools, users and developers can see the functionality of the code's process if they seek insight into the workings of the project.  

## Future Updates 

1. Brand assets and branding across web application.
2. Job listing .pops up on map area with clickable pin.
3. Update validation for user input ie. country spellcheck etc with workable libraries or arrays
4. Catch functions
5. Throw functions.
6. Check if there is a limit on ISO countries accepted in Adzuna API and adjust code to limit, or extend API use for more global opportunities.
7. Extend the functionality to accommodate businesses/companies seeking local employees. 
8. Crossover business targeted version with employee targeted version to link active seekers of local employees/employers.
